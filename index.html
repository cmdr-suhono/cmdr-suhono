            <h1>IT'S JUST ELITE: DANGEROUS.</h1>
            <p>You are playing a <i>video game</i> and <i>pretending to fly spaceships.</i> Really. That's all it is. That's really all it is. If you are MAD and ANGRY about something, you really should reevaluate your priorities and maybe invest your energy into something productive. Read a book! Go say something nice to someone! But please, <i>chill out</i>, for Braben's sake. You can do so much better than this.</p>
