            <p>You are playing a <i>video game</i> and <i>pretending to fly spaceships.</i> Really. That's all it is. If you are MAD and ANGRY about something, you should reevaluate your priorities and invest your energy into something positive or productive instead. Read a book! Go do something nice for someone! Watch Bob Ross episodes! Whatever you do, please, <i>chill out</i>. You can do better than this.</p>
